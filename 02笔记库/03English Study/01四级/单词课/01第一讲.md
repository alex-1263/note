It is now taking **steps** to fight against what is called a silent kill<span style="background:#f9fd04">er</span>. High blood pressure can lead to **strokes** and a <b><font color=#008ccb>heart</font></b> attack.

They are the number one **causes** of death **globally**. High blood pressure also leads to **kidney failure**, **blindness** and other illnesses. It often goes hand in hand with <b><font color=#008ccb>diabetes</font></b> and **obesity**, which increases heath risks even further.

As the WHO reports, people in **developing countries** in <b><font color=#008ccb>Africa</font></b> suffer more from high blood pressure than people in **developed countries**. The reason is that health care in the developed world is much better organized and people go to the doctor soon enough.

High blood pressure should never be **ignored** and always taken seriously. It is a warning sign from your body that something is not OK. <b><span style="background:#f9fd04">Although</span></b> people may live with high blood pressure for years without even knowing it<span style="background:#f9fd04">,</span> it is important to check your blood pressure regularly and take the **necessary** steps.

The WHO says that you can **reduce** your blood pressure by changing your living habits. Eating <font color=#008ccb>a balanced diet</font>, <font color=#008ccb>exercising regularly</font>, **avoiding** alcohol and nicotine are some things that you can do without **consulting** a doctor.
